# Prerendering with node.js
Same app in two editions - one rendered fully on the client, second one utilising pupeteer to generate HTML server side.

## Getting Started

Install node packages in every project with 

```
npm install
```

and then start with either

```
clientsiderenderedapp.bat
```

for the app rendered fully on the client

or with 

```
serversiderenderedapp.bat
```
for the server side rendered app.

Windows script only (sorry) - easy enough to run it on Linux.
